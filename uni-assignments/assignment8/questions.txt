1. To get a three-dimensional context we can trade "2d", with "webgl". 
Then the web content uses an API based on OpenGL ES to perform the rendering.
It is also possible to use a "webgl" library with a 2d canvas.

2. First of all, get the canvas element and define its context.
Then I would do:
context.beginPath();
context.fillStyle = 'blue';
context.arc(xPosition, yPosition, radius, 0, 2*Math.PI, true);
context.fill()

3. A more terse code:
const countries = ['Norway', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'New Zealand'];
const countriesStartingWithN = countries.filter(country => country.startsWith('N'));
