        <p>My name is Magnus Byrkjeland, and I am 20 years old.</p>
        <p>I have been coding before. The first time I coded was when I was creating Minecraft servers that could run plugins 
            (which was quite the hassle).
            Then i took "Informasjonsteknologi" at highschool, which brought me into HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL and Javascript. 
            I did some projects at home when I wanted to try some stuff, and since then have tried out JSON, Node.js, Python, 
            and a couple of snippets from other languages.
        </p>
        <p>My expectations of this course will be that beginners get a good understanding about coding, 
            and get to understand the "mindset"/"the way to think" when coding.
            Also I hope i get to correct som bad habits:)</p>

            <h2>Questions</h2>
        </header>
        <ol>
            <li>The server in a client server architecture, responds to requests, retrieves and transmits files to clients.</li>
            <li>The client in a client server architecture, 
                makes requests to servers using for example browsers to locate and display information from the web.
                The client can communicate with servers using the HTTP protocol (HyperText Transfer Protocol) 
                to retrieve files with HTML that the browser can render on the computerscreen. 
                Another way a client can communicate to a server is through the FTP protocol (File Transfer Protocol).</li>
            <li>An IP address is a unique identification/address that every unit on the web gets. 
                It is used to make sure the units know where to ask for information, and send information.</li>
            <li>A DNS is basicly a phonebook for IP-addresses. To make it easier for humans to for example browse the internet, 
                IP-addresses can be connected to domains. This information is stored on a "Domain Name Server"
                When we search for a domain in our browsers address bar, 
                our computer sends a request to a DNS to find the IP-address connected to the domain. 
                When the IP is sent to us, our computer is able to access the server with the designated IP-address.</li>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Internet is the network of computers communicating with eachother. </li>
                    <li>The World Wide Web is an application running on The Internet. 
                        It is a way for computers to find documents stored on other computers</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>HTML ("HyperText Markup Language") is a coding language that is made to format and describe the structure of pages/documents. 
                It uses brackets "&lt;&gt;" and text to create elements, for example "&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;". The brackets and text form "tags". 
                Between the tags, you can put another element, pictures, videos, audio files, plain text among other things.
