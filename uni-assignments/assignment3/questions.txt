1. The difference between "position: absolute" and "position: fixed":
    - "position: absolute" makes the element stay in one place relative to its parent-element. 
        Lets say you place the element in the bottom right corner of the parent-element, 
        it will stay there and follow its parent if the page is scrolled.
    - "position: fixed" positions an element relative to the viewport. Even if the page is scrolled, the element won't move.

2. With CSS3, we can access the third element of another element by following the path to the element and using :nth-child(3). 
    If I have a div-element with 5 paragraphs, in another div-element, I can reference to the third paragraph by writing "div div p:nth-child(3)" in the css-file.
