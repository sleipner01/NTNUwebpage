   -Class is best used the styling can be reused elsewhere. If I have a section with width: 300px and background-color: lightgray, and want to make to more sections looking the same, I can give all the sections the same class. They will get the same styling with less coding needed.

Written rgba(x(amount of red), y(amount of green), z(amound of blue), o(decimal/percentage of the opacity)), the different values will give different colors. The opacity value makes the color slightly og completely transparent which lets anything that lies beneath shine through. It is possible to pick between 16 581 375 different colours.

5. The CSS selector that matches all the p elements inside the article is: "article p {}"
